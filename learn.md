By following the CamJam Edu Kit 1 resource you will learn:

- How simple components (LEDs, Buttons and Buzzers) are to be connected on a breadboard
- How to use Python and GPIO Zero to control simple components
- How to use a `while` loop to continue a block of code forever
- How to use `button.is_pressed` to determine the state of a Button
- How to use an `if` statement to control program flow
- How to use `button.wait_for_press` to halt the program until the button is pressed
- How to use `led.blink()` with optional parameters to flash an LED on and off continuously at different speeds
- How to write a sequence of instructions to model a real world system like traffic lights and a pedestrian crossing
